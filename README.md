# Sindhi-Keyboard-Layout
================================
Sindhi Keyboard Layout Compatible with Windows 7, 8 and 10 with Sindhi (8,10) and Persian (7) Keyboards.

Sindhi Keyboard Layout for Compatible with Windows 7, 8 and 10 works with the Sindhi Pakistan Language that comes with windows.

Original issue was that there was no any standard keyboard layout for Sindhi Language which resolves issue of final heh (ہ) for concluding the Sindhi words like (بہ/ تہ /نہ /ڳالهہ/ ٻولهہ)

After finding this webpage https://www.google.com/inputtools/try/, I found the perfect layout that works for windows OS. There are seperate installation for Windows 7, 8 and 10.

Since, the source files and installation files are successfully works for all Windows platform running in this time.
